## Landscape 
* Paypals driving facot is that of a middleman in the payment space between both merchants and consumers. 
* With the world becoming more digital and along with that the payment environment having a strong and proven solutions with a strong following is of an advantage to the company. 
* The company had to evolve and innovate over the years as what is described by CEO Meg Whitman as being a three phase strategy. 
  - Phase 1 
     - Having a strong base with businesse and individuals who do not have the abiltiy to accept credit cards or even obtain credit themseleves. Paypal's solution enabling these users to fund an account using their own bank account and not have a concern that their information to unknown sellers. Using this as a baseline to build on. With the goal of PayPal to earn interest on these accounts however not reality as most users withdraw any funds immediately and large majority only used credit cards, costing Paypal roughly 2% per transaction. In need to change. 
  - Phase 2 
     - To solve this issue Paypal tailored their product to business accounts. Instead of relying on interest earnings from deposits they had the ability to apply service charges. Offering seller protection, ensured they complied with reimbursement policies. 
  - Phase 3 
     - Having established a strong business model and increased domestic and international penetration on eBay, they started their off-eBay strategy. This was accomplished by: 
        - Developing growth in active users, by adding them across multiple platforms. 
        - 2003 created a new business unit with Paypal as a Merchant Service. Providing payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay austion community. 
        - 2004 PayPal Merchant Services launched several initiatives to enrol merchants from outside the eBay world including:
          - lowering transaction fees. 
          - Getting users to recruit non e-Bay merchants with a referral bonus of up to $1,000.00
          - Getting credit card gateways to include them as an offering to online merchants 
          - Hiring a new sales force 
          - Reducing fees 
          - Launching Paypal Mobile 
  - Even with a strong platform to build on and proven success Paypal continue to encounter new competition within their space. The top four competitors are: 
     - **Skrill** with the biggest differentiator being their fees, 2.9% vs. 4.5%
    - **Payoneer** offering two account types, a free account allowing money withdrawal into your bank. The other a prepaid card only available to individuals. 
    - **Google Pay Send** designed to send money to and from anywhere for any reason. Wing a zero fee charge on debit transactions vs. Paypals 2.9% they pose a risk. 
    - **Stripe** a strong competitor in the online space but not much else. 
## Results
* Although Paypal provides similar services to those of traditional institutions, consumers use them differenctly. Customers of Paypal do have the ability to transfer funds, buy products and keep funds in their account. However account balances are normally no more than $70.00 compared to banks holding allot more of the customers funds. 
* However as their solution offering grows and the more they become part of everyday life, they could become a greater threat to banks. 
* In order to ensure success the company must consitantly increase its Total Payments Volume (TPV), total dollar value of transacctions. Othere metrics include customers base, account count, active account count and total spend. 
## Recommendations
* In order to expand their business Paypal should look into the full spectrum within a B2B payment cycle. Understand what is broken within that cycel and what more can be done to support seemless payment process. For instance, a solution utilizing Blockchain could facilitate the incrimental or even bulk payments across a fast area of service providers and logic channels, customs, taxes and fees. Managing each aspect of the transaction with a Smartcontract which could identify each piece of a payment could allow for payments to be broken up and send to each debtor automatically as payments are intered. This will create effencies and speed up payment cycles via a banking platform, taking days to instant.
